# Apollo Movie Application

Movie app built with React, Apollo and GraphQL

Env:
React, React-Apollo, Styled components, react-router-dom

I made simple movie suggestion app with React and Apollo. GraphQL server is in https://github.com/Korea-code/movieQL, I didn't deploy the server, so the server host is set on Localhost:4000. You need to run the server to see the app.

Basically this app shows posters getting over 8.5 rating points, and when clike a poster, you can see title, rating, language, description and suggested movies link with poster.
